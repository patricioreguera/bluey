			"Bluey is a 6 year old Blue Heeler pup who loves to play. Her parents and teacher give her lots of time to practice, which means she’s become very good at inventing games, helping everyone choose their roles and deciding on the rules. Her favourite games are ones that involve lots of other kids and grown-ups (especially her dad) and she mainly likes to pretend she’s a grown up doing grownup things herself.",

		description:
			"Bingo is Bluey's younger sister. She’s 4 years old, and a red heeler like her mum. Bingo also likes to play but she is a bit quieter than Bluey, so is more likely to be the customer than the shop owner. Sometimes though, when Bluey asks her to be the doctor, rather than the patient, she really enjoys it. When she’s not playing you can find her in the yard talking to tiny bugs or off lost in her own beautiful world.",

He still tries to continue his own life amidst the chaos of childrearing but often struggles to juggle these two competing tasks!",
